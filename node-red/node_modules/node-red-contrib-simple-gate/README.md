# node-red-contrib-simple-gate
A Node-RED node for controlling message flow.

## Install

Use the Node-RED `Manage Palette` command or run the following in your Node-RED user directory (typically `~/.node-red`):

    npm install node-red-contrib-simple-gate

## Usage

The `gate` node will transmit the input message to its output when in the `open` state and block it when `closed`. Messages that arrive when the gate is `closed` are discarded. If it is desired to save those messages for future delivery, the `q-gate` node, published as [node-red-contrib-queue-gate](https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-queue-gate) is available.

Messages with the user-defined topic `Control Topic` (set when the node is deployed) are not passed through but are used to control the state of the gate.

Control messages can have values representing commands for `open`, `close`, `toggle`, and `default`. The (case-insensitive) strings representing these commands are set by the user when the node is deployed. Since version 0.3.0, if a control message is received with a payload that is a number or boolean, the payload is converted to a string and then tested against the command definitions. If a command is not recognized, there is no output or change of state, and the node reports an error.

When first deployed or after a `default` command, the gate is in the user-selected state defined by `Default State` (see below regarding persistence).


## Node status
The state of the gate is indicated by a status object: text and either a green dot (`open`) or a red ring (`closed`).

## State persistence (since version 0.2.0)
By default, the node enters the `Default State` on startup, either when first deployed in the editor, re-deployed as part of a modified flow or entire workspace, or when Node-RED is restarted by the user or by a system service. The user can, however, select the `Restore from saved state` option (checkbox) in the edit dialog. Then, if a persistent form of context storage has been enabled in the Node-RED `settings.js` file, the node will attempt to enter the state last saved in the node context and will use the `Default State` only if no saved state is available.

## Examples
### Basic Operation
This flow demonstrates the basic operation of the `gate` node and the commands that can be used to change its state.

### Dashboard Control
This flow shows how the `gate` node can be controlled from the dashboard using buttons and switches.
